| About                             | I am not a programmer. I am just a poor chemical engineer, and a big fan of ttrpgs. So yes, the code might look like Chaos (which is fine, I am a Tzeench follower myself). It might be difficult to understand why I structured things this way, and there might be a better way of organising it, I know. Just bear with me, if you tell me how and help me, we can all get a great version of Sandbox. If you need clarification, just ask me, I am @Seregras in the Foundry discord channel. | Software developer working in industry automation specialized on data acquisition & visualization |
